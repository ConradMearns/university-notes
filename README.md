# Building

```build.bat``` will handle cleanup and building using pdflatex. Options exist to build either one, or all available ```.tex``` files.

```build.bat -a``` will build every available ```.tex``` file.

```build.bat MATH175.tex``` will only build the file for MATH175.

Anyone is welcome to contribute. If there's some small error, create an Issue ticket. If you would rather fix or add content youself, make a pull request.
