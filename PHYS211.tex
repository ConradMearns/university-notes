When multiplying or dividing, the result is as precise as the least precise input to the number of digits.\\
Example: $54.3 * 6.8991 = 374.62113$, truncated to $374$ or rounded to $375$.\\\\

\noindent
When adding or subtracting, the result is as precise as the least precise input to the nuber of digits post decimal place.\\
Example: $10.65 + 3.0 = 13.65$, truncated to $13.6$ or rounded to $13.7$.\\\\

\noindent
As a general rule (from the professor), round up down to the nearset even number, as always rounding up will accumulate more error.

Variables of Movement and Position\\
\normalsize

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Position: Location in space with respect to another object or coordinate system.\\
    $x, y, z$
  \item Displacement: Difference in position at two different times.\\
    $\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z, \Delta x = x_2 - X_1$
  \item Average Velocity: Displacement divided by time.\\\
    $v_{avg}, v_{avg} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
  \item Speed: Total distance divided by time.\\
    $s, s \equiv \frac{d}{t}$
  \item Instantanious Velocity: Velocity measured at a single time.\\
    $v, v = \lim_{t \to a}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \lim_{t \to a}\frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}$
\end{enumerate}

Motion at Constant Velocity\\
\normalsize
\noindent
$x = x_0 + vt$
The following computes a new position of $x$ according to an object's initial position ($x_0$), velocity ($v$) and the given time passed ($t$). The equation is a slope-intercept formula.

\Large
Velocity at Constant Acceleration\\
\normalsize
\noindent
$v = v_0 + at$
The following computes a new velocity of $v$ according to an object's initial velocity ($v_0$), acceleration ($a$) and the given time passed ($t$). The equation is a slope-intercept formula.

\indent
The following equations can be combined as a system to calculate constant acceleration with velocity, position and time.
When given a final velocity $v_f$ and an initial velocity $v_0$ one can deduce an average velocity ($v$ or $v_{avg}$)\\
$v_f = v_0 + at$ and $x = x_0 + vt \to x = x_0 + (\frac{v_0 + v_f}{2})t \to x = x_0 + \frac{1}{2}(v_0 + v_0 + at)t \to x = x_0 + v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ after simplification.

Vectors and Vector Math\\
\normalsize
\begin{itemize}
  \item Scalar $\equiv$ number, units $\equiv$ magnitude
  \item Vector $\equiv$ number, units, direction $\equiv$ magnitude, direction
\end{itemize}

\indent
Vectors allow for easier representation of position, velocity, and acceleration. A vector of velocity looks like $\vec{v}$ and can be drawn to look like the following.

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw (0,0) node [left] {$\vec{v}$};
  \draw [-latex, thick] (0,0) -- (1,1);
\end{tikzpicture}

Vector addition takes two vectors and aligns them tail to tip. For example, suppose the following vectors $\vec{a}$, $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ such that $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{c}$.

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw (0,0) node [right] {$\vec{a}$};
  \draw [-latex, thick] (0,0) -- (1,1);

  \draw (1,1) node [right] {$\vec{b}$};
  \draw [-latex, thick] (1,1) -- (0,1);

  % Two pics

  \draw (5,0) node [right] {$\vec{a}$};
  \draw [-latex] (5,0) -- (6,1);

  \draw (6,1) node [right] {$\vec{b}$};
  \draw [-latex] (6,1) -- (5,1);

  \draw (5,0) node [left] {$\vec{c}$};
  \draw [-latex, thick] (5,0) -- (5,1);

\end{tikzpicture}

\noindent
Vector addition is communative. $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b} + \vec{a}$
Vector addition is associativ. $\vec{a} + (\vec{b} + \vec{c}) = (\vec{a} + \vec{b}) + \vec{c}$

\indent
Unit Vectors are vectors of magnitude of 1 that extend in only the x, y, or z direction alone a 3D cartessian system. The vectors are $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$ and $\hat{k}$ respectively. Notation for vectors, when expanded, looks like $\vec{A} = (A_x\hat{i} - A_y\hat{j} + A_z\hat{k})$ which could be $=(12\hat{i} - 7\hat{j} + 14\hat{k})$. Vector addition becomes standard addition, and multplying vectors by scalars only needs to be distributed.

Circular Motion\\
\normalsize
\noindent

Angular vectors use radius unit vector ($\hat{r}$) and an inclination unit vector ($\hat{\theta}$). Position around a circle can be determined if given an average velocity and time.\\
Let $T = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$ where $r$ is the radius and $v$ is the velocity.\\
Position: $\vec{r}(t) = r\cos{\frac{2\pi r}{T}}\hat{i} + r\sin{\frac{2\pi r}{T}}\hat{j}$\\
Velocity (derivative of position): $\vec{v}(t) = -r\frac{2\pi}{T}\sin{\frac{2\pi r}{T}}\hat{i} + r\frac{2\pi}{T}\cos{\frac{2\pi r}{T}}\hat{j}$\\
Acceleration (derivative of velocity): $\vec{a}(t) = -r\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}\cos{\frac{2\pi r}{T}}\hat{i} - r\frac{4\pi^2}{T^2}\sin{\frac{2\pi r}{T}}\hat{j}$\\
Or\\
$\vec{a}_{centrip} = -\frac{v^2}{r}\hat{r}$

\Large
Relativity\\
\normalsize
\indent
Motion and position are dependant on a specific inertial reference frame - some body with no apparent acceleration. It was believed by Aristotle that the Earth was the reference frame for everything, i.e. it was the center of the universe. A reference frame is represented mathematically as the origin.\\
All motion and laws of motion must work and provide the same result across refernce frames. Using this fact, you can calculate the time it takes for an arrow to hit a wall when the reference frame is the archer, and come out with the same result when the wall hits the arrow when the arrow is the reference frame.
