When multiplying or dividing, the result is as precise as the least precise input to the number of digits.\\
Example: $54.3 * 6.8991 = 374.62113$, truncated to $374$ or rounded to $375$.\\\\

\noindent
When adding or subtracting, the result is as precise as the least precise input to the nuber of digits post decimal place.\\
Example: $10.65 + 3.0 = 13.65$, truncated to $13.6$ or rounded to $13.7$.\\\\

\noindent
As a general rule (from the professor), round up down to the nearset even number, as always rounding up will accumulate more error.
